Advent of Code event 2023

## Usage

Run in terminal
```
python3 main.py
```

Choose Problem you want to run by entering number from 1-25. Both parts of the Problem will then be calculated and printed to the console

## Write solution

For each new day create a new Folder like this 
```
day<day_number>
```

Inside this folder there has to be a file ```part1.py``` and ```part2.py```

Both of those files have to have a ```solution``` function which does not take any arguments and returns the solution for part 1 of the problem (or part 2 correspondingly)

No printing of the solution should be handled by the solution-modules itself
